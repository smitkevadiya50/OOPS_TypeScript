# TypeScript OOP Concepts Examples

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to demonstrating the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using TypeScript: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. Each TypeScript file in this repository provides a clear example of these concepts.

## Files and Descriptions

### Abstraction.ts
- **Description:** This file illustrates the concept of Abstraction in TypeScript. It focuses on showing how to abstract complex logic behind simpler interfaces.

### Encapsulation.ts
- **Description:** A detailed example of Encapsulation in TypeScript. This file demonstrates how to protect object states by encapsulating data and methods within classes.

### Inheritance.ts
- **Description:** Showcases the use of Inheritance in TypeScript. It explains how new classes can inherit properties and methods from existing classes, promoting code reuse and hierarchy.

### Polymorphism.ts
- **Description:** This file provides an example of Polymorphism in TypeScript. It demonstrates how objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.

## Getting Started
To run these TypeScript examples, ensure you have TypeScript installed and configured in your development environment. Compile each TypeScript file to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler and then run it using Node.js.

Example:
```bash
tsc Abstraction.ts
node Abstraction.js
